# Intelligent Commute

Pioneering an Intelligent Real-Time Bus Tracking System with Online Registration and Monitoring. Features include dynamic scheduling, complaint/suggestion analysis for transit facility optimization.

### Introduction:

The public favors bus transport due to its practicality and affordability, especially in academic settings like colleges and universities where parking is scarce and traffic congestion is common. Students prefer buses for their convenience, social opportunities, and safety. To enhance the experience, a project is underway to enable students to track their bus's real-time location. In case of emergencies, alerts will be communicated via a virtual notice board. Furthermore, administrators can streamline registration and monitor all buses' locations online, reducing manual effort.

### Problem Statement:

The management teams in charge of bus transportation sometimes offer poor transit services. Students only have access to the bus's scheduled arrival time, which can change significantly or perhaps never arrive in case of a serious emergency. Students, therefore need a system that can track the location of their bus in real-time and provide them with necessary updates no matter where they are. The bus transportation system should also be enhanced to offer a better experience when compared to the flight systems. Because bus services do not use real-time tracking technology, the majority of the issues arise. The proposed system will deal with these circumstances since the administrator will be able to follow the real-time location of every bus.

### Problem Solution:

This project aims to create a real-time bus-tracking system for students and administrators. Through this system, students will register themselves online. Once the administrator will approve the student's registration, the student will access the application by signing in. When it comes to the student's bus stop, they will monitor the bus arrival and departure times after registering. They will also receive important notifications regarding bus timetables, and other emergencies, etc. The administration will also promptly update information online, doing away with the custom of putting bus schedules in paper form on notice boards. The system offers a platform that will enable the administrator to change the bus schedule online rather than posting the timetable on a paper noticeboard. Since they will be tracking the bus in real-time and arriving at their stop in good time, students won't need to wait for the bus anymore, reducing the risk of missing it. Through this system's complaint/suggestion feature, students will be able to express complaints or suggestions regarding the transit facility.
