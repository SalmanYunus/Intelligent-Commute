# Intelligent Commute

Pioneering an Intelligent Real-Time Bus Tracking System with Online Registration and Monitoring. Features include dynamic scheduling, complaint/suggestion analysis for transit facility optimization.

### Introduction:

The public favors bus transport due to its practicality and affordability, especially in academic settings like colleges and universities where parking is scarce and traffic congestion is common. Students prefer buses for their convenience, social opportunities, and safety. To enhance the experience, a project is underway to enable students to track their bus's real-time location. In case of emergencies, alerts will be communicated via a virtual notice board. Furthermore, administrators can streamline registration and monitor all buses' locations online, reducing manual effort.

### Problem Statement:

Students often encounter poor transit services due to the lack of real-time tracking in bus transportation systems. Unlike flight systems, where real-time updates are standard, students are left relying solely on scheduled arrival times, which can be unreliable, especially during emergencies. To address this, a proposed system will enable students to track their bus's location in real-time, ensuring they receive timely updates regardless of their location. This enhancement aims to provide a better overall experience compared to current bus services.

### Problem Solution:

This project aims to develop a real-time bus-tracking system for students and administrators. Students will register online and gain access upon approval. They can monitor bus arrival/departure times, receive notifications, and access updated information, eliminating the need for paper schedules. Administrators can manage schedules online. Real-time tracking ensures students arrive at stops promptly, reducing wait times and missed buses. A complaint/suggestion feature allows students to provide feedback on the transit service.
